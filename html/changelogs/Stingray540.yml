# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.

changes: 
  - tweak: "Moves Spartan/Elite EVA mode to an "Abilities" tab along with the Spartan's Self Destruct. Adds a dedicated button for the latter for quick access."
  - tweak: "Updates my ancient grunt limiting code to include the Covenant LMG. No more Grunt LMG abuse."
    tweak: "Adds a system similar to the one that stops grunts using beam rifles to prevent bugs from using the fuel-rod. This could be expanded upon later for other species and weapons after further discussion."
